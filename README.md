I'm speedrunning Nextjs for my seminar.

If you're asking what is this project it basically just another fucking dating app bootleg

Don't know why my tutor is obsess with dating web-app tho (maybe bro is single)

But this is my full-stack web dev speed run of next.js (i know what you think. Again with the web ?)

This will be the last fucking time i work with web i can guarantee that.
